# MSAL Node Standalone Sample: Custom INetworkModule Implementation and Network Tracing Via "Fiddler Everywhere"

This sample demonstrates how to implement a custom [INetworkModule](https://azuread.github.io/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/ref/interfaces/_azure_msal_common.inetworkmodule.html) that makes it simple for developers to debug network errors. There are two ways to run the sample: one is "as-is" in app.ts, the other is via an express server in express.ts. Additionally, instructions are provided on how to use [Fiddler Everywhere](https://www.telerik.com/fiddler/fiddler-everywhere) to perform a network trace of the application.

Fiddler Everywhere is not supported on all operating systems. [Fiddler Classic](https://www.telerik.com/fiddler/fiddler-classic) is a free Windows-only version of Fiddler Everywhere. It's important to note that AAD no longer supports TLS 1.0, which is the default TLS version in Fiddler Classic. The TLS version can be configured via navigating to Tools > Options > HTTPS, then setting TLS to 1.2.

## Note
This sample is written in TypeScript and was developed with Node version 16.14.0.

## Setup

In a terminal, navigate to the directory where `package.json` resides. Then type:

```console
    npm install
```

## Register

1. Navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and select the **Azure AD** service.
2. Select the **App Registrations** blade on the left, then select **New registration**.
3. In the **Register an application page** that appears, enter registration information:
   - In the **Name** section, enter a meaningful application name that will be displayed to users of the app, for example `Confidential Client Application`.
   - Under **Supported account types**, select **Accounts in this organizational directory only**.
4. Select **Register** to create the application.
5. In the app's registration screen, find and note the **Application (client) ID** and **Directory (Tenant) ID**. These values will be used in the app's configuration file(s) later.
6. In the app's registration screen, select the **Certificates & secrets** blade in the left.
   - In the **Client secrets** section, select **New client secret**.
   - Type a key description (for instance `app_secret`),
   - Select one of the available key durations (6 months, 12 months or Custom).
   - The generated key value will be displayed when the **Add** button is selected. Copy and save the generated value for use in later steps.

Before running the sample, the values in the configuration object in app.ts or express.ts will need to be replaced:

```javascript
const config = {
    auth: {
        clientId: "<ENTER_CLIENT_ID>",
        authority: "https://login.microsoftonline.com/<ENTER_TENANT_ID>",
        clientSecret: "<ENTER_CLIENT_SECRET>",
    },
    ...
};
```

## Implement a custom INetworkModule

There are three approaches to implementing a custom INetworkModule in this sample.
1. The default msal-node (as of v1.15.0) INetworkModule has been copied to HttpClientCurrent.ts and can be imported to app.ts or express.ts to be used as a custom INetworkModule. HttpClientCurrent.ts can be edited to include console.log()'s to see how network traffic is processed.
2. The pre-proxy-support msal-node INetworkModule has been copied to HttpClientAxios.ts and can be imported to app.ts or express.ts to be used as a custom INetworkModule. HttpClientAxios.ts can be edited to include console.log()'s to see how network traffic is processed. `NOTE: Axios does not support proxy functionality. Therefore, neither does HttpClientAxios.`
3. A custom INetworkModule can be implemeted inline in the system configuration. Stubs to mock the default implementation of INetworkModule have been provided.

## Use Fiddler Everywhere to perform a network trace
Fiddler acts as a proxy and monitors all traffic on a local network

1. Download and install [Fiddler Everywhere](https://www.telerik.com/download/fiddler-everywhere)
2. Uncomment the proxyUrl line - this tells the sample app to route all traffic through the proxy that Fiddler Everywhere operates on (the port can be configured in the settings of Fiddler Everywhere)

## Run the app

Before running the sample (and everytime changes are made to the sample), the TypeScript will need to be compiled. In the same folder, type:

```console
    npx tsc
```
This will compile the TypeScript into JavaScript, and put the compiled files in the /dist folder.

The sample can now be run by typing:
```console
    node dist/app.js
```
or
```console
    node dist/express.js
```

Two different npm scripts, which will run the above npx and node commands, has been configured in package.json. To compile and start either sample, type:
```console
    npm run start:app
```
or
```console
    npm run start:express
```

### If using `npm run start:app`

The token returned from Azure AD should be immediately displayed in the terminal.

If Fiddler Everywhere was downloaded and installed, HttpClientAxios is not being used as the networkClient, and the proxyUrl line was uncommented: the network requests will be displayed inside of Fiddler Everywhere.

### If using `npm run start:express`

http://localhost:3000 must be navigated to in a browser.

The token should then be returned from Azure AD and displayed in the terminal.

If Fiddler Everywhere was downloaded and installed, HttpClientAxios is not being used as the networkClient, and the proxyUrl line was uncommented: the network requests will be displayed inside of Fiddler Everywhere.
