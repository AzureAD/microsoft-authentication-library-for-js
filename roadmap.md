# Roadmap

The MSAL.js team's roadmap is presented as _In Development_, _Up Next_, and _Under Consideration_ to give you a better idea of what we are currently working on, what is up next for us, and what we are considering for the future. These are not guaranteed timelines or commitments, but instead intended to provide insight into the team's current direction. As an open-source library, you can already view changes the team is actively working on. This roadmap is focused on big features or focus areas; it may not call out each individual work item that is added to the library. While we try to stay consistent with our plans, things can change quickly. Do not write code reliant on these features until they are officially shipped.

If you don't see a feature listed on the roadmap, check our [Release Notes](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/releases) to see if it has already been released. If not, please open a [Feature Request](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feature-unconfirmed%2Cquestion&template=feature_request.yml).

## Terminology
- *In Development*: These items are well-defined and actively in development.
- *Up Next*: These items are next to be picked up for development when capacity allows. The problem space and solution are known but we may still be refining design details or prioritizing capacity for other items already In Development.
- *Under Consideration*: These are general topic areas the team is considering for future investigation but we have no timelines or prioritization. If you have thoughts or suggestions on these areas, please add them to an existing Feature Request.
