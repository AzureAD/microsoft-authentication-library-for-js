 * - account                - Account entity to lookup the credentials.
 * - forceRefresh           - Forces silent requests to make network calls if true.
 * - extraQueryParameters   - String to string map of custom query parameters added to the /authorize call. Only used when renewing the refresh token.
 * - tokenBodyParameters    - String to string map of custom token request body parameters added to the /token call. Only used when renewing access tokens.
